⚠ Important Note ⚠

Due to a Sublime Text limitation on file
extensions, highlighting for SSH Config
files is NOT ACTIVATED AUTOMATICALLY for
~/.ssh/config, where it is most useful.

The easiest way to adjust is to open your
SSH Config file from the command palette
(Primary+Shift+P) and use the following
command:

    SSH Config: Open SSH Config File

For more details (and more workarounds),
